# Responsive Portfolio

The objective for this project was to make a responsive webpage that adjusts its contents when viewed at different pixels. The webpage must also be inter-linked amongst three different pages (index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html).

I also got practice working with the Bootstrap framework. I implemented multiple Bootstrap components and customized them through my "style.css" document. This project also required me to become better aquainted using the "dev tools -> inspect" function availabe in Chrome.
